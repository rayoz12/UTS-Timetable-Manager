# UTS Timetable Manager

A JavaFX application written to manage students and their enrolments in various subjects.

Written in the Model View Architecture Pattern (MVC) with JavaFX providing the binding capabilties between the model and the view.

One of the first Java Applications I wrote and it introduced me to the world of observables and binding data objects to a view representation. Refer to my Music Player Application to how much I didn't know exactly.
